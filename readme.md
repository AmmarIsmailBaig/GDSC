# Analysis Report: Visualization of Iris Dataset

Objective:
Explore the Iris dataset through visualization to understand the distribution and relationships between features.

1. Dataset Overview:
150 samples of iris flowers with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

2. Key Findings:

Classes (setosa, versicolor, virginica) are balanced.
Sepal length and petal length show strong positive correlation.
3. Visualizations:

Descriptive statistics, class distribution, histograms, and box plots were employed for comprehensive exploration.
Pair plots and scatter plots highlight relationships between features.
4. Insights:

Features exhibit distinct patterns for different iris species.
Identified correlations provide valuable information for further analysis.
5. Conclusion:
Visualization analysis offers insights into feature relationships and distribution, laying the groundwork for predictive modeling.


# Analysis Report: Sales Prediction Using Linear Regression Model

Objective:
This analysis aims to predict sales using a linear regression model, exploring the relationship between various factors and sales performance.

1. Dataset Overview:
The dataset comprises historical sales data with features like advertising expenses, promotions, and seasonality, along with corresponding sales figures.

2. Data Exploration:
2.1 Descriptive Statistics:

Calculated mean, median, standard deviation, and quartiles to understand the central tendency and spread of each variable.
2.2 Feature Correlation:

Explored correlations between advertising expenses, promotions, and other relevant features to identify potential predictors for sales.
3. Univariate Analysis:
3.1 Histograms:

Visualized the distribution of sales data to identify any skewed patterns and outliers.
3.2 Feature Exploration:

Explored individual features such as advertising expenses and promotions to identify trends or outliers.
4. Linear Regression Model:
4.1 Model Training:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Trained a linear regression model using relevant features as independent variables and sales as the dependent variable.
4.2 Model Evaluation:

Assessed the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared to gauge its accuracy in predicting sales.
5. Insights:

Identified significant positive or negative correlations between certain features and sales.
Evaluated the impact of advertising expenses and promotions on sales.
6. Conclusion:

The linear regression model provides a reasonable prediction of sales based on the selected features.
Insights gained can inform future marketing and promotional strategies.
